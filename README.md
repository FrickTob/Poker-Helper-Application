# Poker-Helper-Application

This is an ongoing project by myself to build a GUI to help people calculate odds of having a winning hand in poker.<br>

-pokerParts contains classes I made to represent various parts of poker such as cards and hands<br>
-pokerData doesn't contain much at the moment but will store data of large calculations so they don't need to be run multiple times<br>
-pokerGUI contains the runnable GUI<br>
-pokerHelp contains classes that deal with logic in determining winning hands<br>
