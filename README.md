# Poker-Helper-Application

This is an ongoing project by myself to build a GUI to help people calculate odds of having a winning hand in poker.

-pokerParts contains classes I made to represent various parts of poker such as cards and hands
-pokerData doesn't contain much at the moment but will store data of large calculations so they don't need to be run multiple times
-pokerGui contains the runnable GUI
-pokerHelp contains classes that deal with logic in determining winning hands
